# Deploying-Model-Pumpkin-Seed-Data
I led a project where I utilized essential features like Area, Perimeter, and more to classify pumpkin seeds. I experimented with decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression, optimizing the best model. Deployed it for local use, benefiting agriculture, quality control, and research.
In this project, I focused on the classification of pumpkin seeds into distinct types using machine learning techniques. I employed a set of essential features, including Area, Perimeter, Major Axis Length, Minor Axis Length, Convex Area, Equivalent Diameter, Eccentricity, Solidity, Extent, Roundness, Aspect Ratio, and Compactness, to train and evaluate the models.

My approach involved experimenting with various classification algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression. I meticulously tuned and optimized these models, ultimately selecting the best-performing one. To ensure accessibility, I deployed the top model and provided the code for local hosting, making seed type classification more practical for applications in agriculture, quality control, and research.

In summary, this project showcases the power of machine learning in accurately classifying pumpkin seeds. The best model was fine-tuned, and its performance was saved in a pickle file for easy access and utilization.
